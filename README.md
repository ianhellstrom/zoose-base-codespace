# GitHub Codespace for Zoose

Run Zoose with many useful Python libraries pre-installed in VSCode directly from your browser with only 2 clicks!

You can either try [Zoose](https://github.com/ianhellstrom/zoose#zoose-base) in VSCode in your browser with only two clicks _or_ run it or any Zoose [flavour](https://github.com/ianhellstrom/zoose#flavours) (e.g. PyTorch, Quantum) from your own GitHub account and repository (recommended).

## Try Zoose Quantum
Click on _Use this template_ and choose _Open in codespace_.

You will be running [Zoose Base](https://ianhellstrom.org/zoose-2.0/#zoose-base) in a GitHub Codespace, straight from this repository.
This is best if you want to give Zoose Base a whirl but do not intend to save your work in your own account.

## Notebooks
Sample notebooks are available in the `notebooks` folder, for which you can find more information on [ianhellstrom.org](https://ianhellstrom.org).
